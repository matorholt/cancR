title: "Install and Update R"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Introduction

This article is for installing R if it has not been installed before and for updating R if this is needed. If R is already installed, skip the installation chapter.

## Installation of R

R is installed from "softwareshoppen" which is found at the desktop. Click "installer" and "bestil" and wait for a couple of minutes.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ss_1.png")
```



After the instillation of R, we also need to install R-studio

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ss_2.png")
```

## Update R

R can be updated directly in R, as "softwareshoppen" is not always up-to-date. This requires a specific package called "installr". The installation needs to be run directly from R and not R-studio.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("u_1.png")
```
