```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Define the export

Open your project in Redcap and find the export tab on the left side

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_0.png")
```

Now create a new report. Here you define which parts of the data in redcap you wish to export.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_1.png")
```

Give the report a name and choose the name of the project under "Add fields from instrument". This adds all data from that specific instrument. In this example the project (instrument) is named MAT.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_2.png")
```

An important field that needs to be checked is that multiple values should be collapsed into one column

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_3.png")
```

## Export Redcap data

When a report/export has been defined it will show in the data exports. Select "export data" to export the specified data in that given export.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_4.png")
```

The format should be semi-colon separated csv.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_5.png")
```

Next, move the file to the data folder in your statistics folder for the project

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_6.png")
```

Rename the file for brevity, here we name it redcap_df. If multiple datasets are placed here add a date.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_7.png")
```

Finally, load the data into R using the function fread. The path can be simplified to: "data/redcap_data.csv" as the project file already knows the entire path to the main folder (working directory). Here we assign the data to the object "raw".

```{r, echo=F, out.width="70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_8.png")
```
