# Introduction

Tables are essential for presenting the study population and the distribution of important covariates. The tablR function in the cancR package is useful for this task.\
\
First we load the cancR package

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(cancR)
```

## Tables with only on group

We use our `redcap_df` as an example. Let us create a simple table of the whole population and present the covariates age, sex and tumor type

```{r, results = "asis"}
tablR(redcap_df,
      vars = c(age, sex, type))
```

We instantly conclude that sex and type is incorrectly formatted, as we wish to see percentages and not a median as if the 0/1 structure was numeric. We convert the variables using `factR()` and pipe into the `tablR()`. Notice that when we pipe we do not need to specify the data frame in `tablR()`

```{r, results = "asis"}
redcap_df %>% 
  factR(c(sex, type)) %>% 
  tablR(vars = c(age, sex, type))
```

## Tables with multiple groups

If we want to compare multiple groups, we use the `group` argument. Let us compare tumor types

```{r, results = "asis"}
redcap_df %>% 
  factR(c(sex, type)) %>% 
  tablR(group = type,
        vars = c(age, sex))
```

We can also add a `total`column and also test the differences in distributions

```{r, results = "asis"}
redcap_df %>% 
  factR(c(sex, type),
        levels = list("type" = c("0", "1", "2"))) %>% 
  tablR(group = type,
        vars = c(age, sex),
        test = TRUE,
        total = TRUE)
```

## Customizing tables

Most of the content of the table can be customized in `tablR()`

### Changing labels

It is possible to rename three types of labels:\
- Group names: `labs.groups`
- Variable names: `labs.headings`
- Variable labels/levels: `labs.subheadings`


```{r}
redcap_df %>%
  factR(c(type, sex)) %>%
  tablR(
    group = type,
    vars=c(age, sex),
    labs.groups = list("type" = list("benign" = "0",
                                     "in situ" = "1",
                                     "malignant" = "2")),
    labs.headings = list("Age at Debut" = "age"),
    labs.subheadings = list("sex" = list("Female" = "2",
                                         "Male" = "1")))
```

### Changing orders

The order of the groups and variable levels can be specified with the `reference()` and `levels()` arguments

```{r}
redcap_df %>%
  factR(c(type, sex, localisation)) %>%
  tablR(
    group = type,
    vars=c(age, sex, localisation),
    labs.groups = list("type" = list("benign" = "0",
                                     "in situ" = "1",
                                     "malignant" = "2")),
    labs.headings = list("Age at Debut" = "age"),
    labs.subheadings = list("sex" = list("Female" = "2",
                                         "Male" = "1"),
                            "localisation" = list("Neck" = "0",
                                                  "Head" = "1",
                                                  "Trunk" = "2",
                                                  "Upper Extremity" = "3",
                                                  "Lower Extremity" = "4",
                                                  "Unspecified" = "5")),
    reference = list("sex" = c("Female")),
    levels = list("localisation" = c("Trunk", "Head")))
```

### Changing summary measures

The default summary measures for continuous variables are median, interquartile range and range. This can be specified in the `numeric()` argument

```{r}
redcap_df %>%
  factR(c(type, sex, localisation)) %>%
  tablR(
    group = type,
    vars=c(age, sex, localisation),
    labs.groups = list("type" = list("Benign" = "0",
                                     "In situ" = "1",
                                     "Malignant" = "2")),
    labs.headings = list("Age at Debut" = "age"),
    labs.subheadings = list("sex" = list("Female" = "2",
                                         "Male" = "1"),
                            "localisation" = list("Neck" = "0",
                                                  "Head" = "1",
                                                  "Trunk" = "2",
                                                  "Upper Extremity" = "3",
                                                  "Lower Extremity" = "4",
                                                  "Unspecified" = "5")),
    reference = list("sex" = c("Female")),
    levels = list("localisation" = c("Trunk", "Head"),
                  "type" = c("Benign", "In situ", "Malignant")),
    numeric = c("mean", "sd"))
```
