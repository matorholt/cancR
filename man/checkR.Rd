\title{Detection of positivity violations (empty levels)}
\usage{
checkR(data, treatment, outcome, vars, levels = 1, quantiles = 0.1, id = id)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame to detect positivity violations}

\item{treatment}{the main stratum which all covariates should include all levels of (optional)}

\item{outcome}{the outcome variable which all covariates should include all levels of (optional)}

\item{vars}{the covariates to examine for positivity violations. State multiple variables as c(var1, var2, var3) without quotes.}

\item{levels}{the number of combinations of covariates. level=1 (default) corresponds to a 2x2 table, whereas level=2 corresponds to 2x2 tables stratified on e.g. treatment}

\item{quantiles}{quantiles for binning of continuous covariates}

\item{id}{column indicating unique patient identifier for returning specific NAs}
}
\value{
prints the variables with positivity violations if present. Otherwise none detected. Also returns as either NULL or character for downstream use.
